      <description>I got my first computer when I was 12, but did nothing with it but to play video games until I was 14. In that time, there was a growing culture of blogging among Iranian youth and I also created my own blog on a local blogging platform (Blogfa) to write about things like video games, tech news, etc. Needing to customize the appearance and functionality of my blog, I became familiar with HTML and Javascript.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Ali Orouji, a computer engineer who is a bit more social than the other computer engineers. I was born in Miyana (a little town in East Azerbaijan, Iran) in 1992, but didn&amp;rsquo;t stay there for a long time. We traveled across the country and lived in many cities. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m in Tehran, working at Cafebazaar as a software engineer.
In this blog, I&amp;rsquo;m going to express my thoughts on many related or unrelated issues to my profession.</description>
